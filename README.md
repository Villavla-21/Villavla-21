<h2>Hi all!</h2>
Iâ€™m @Villavla-21 and I am a recent graduate from mechatronics engineering.<br>
Programming has always been a topic I really enjoy and I am currently looking to gain more experience with hands-on projects or any practical exercises I can find.<br>
I'm looking to gain more experience specifically in web development as full-stack and also as a data scientist
