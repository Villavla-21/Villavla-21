<h2>Hi all!</h2>
Iâ€™m @Villavla-21 and I have always enjoyed programming. <br>
Most recently, exploring and learning about data science has been my main focus area. From time to time, I find it a little easier to explain what I am doing to better understand it. I do not consider myself (in any way) an expert, but feel free to comment, look through or suggest in any of the repos. Always happy to learn something new! <br>
